Hey there!

I've recently started my journey in GitHub to improve my coding skills. And, also will be covering all the basics that could be useful to entry into the VLSI industry.

I will be updating the folders related to Digital design, HDLs, HVLs, and Verification Methodologies.


1. Digital logic deisgn
2. Logic design using Verilog and SV


Happy Learning, Cheers!!
